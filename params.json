Migrate command will also load initial data in database as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python manage.py migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\nNode.js is required for LESS & javascript preprocessing, assuming [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is already installed, let's verify that your site works, run development server and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000), you will see products catalog index page with no products and categories\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python manage.py runserver\r\n```\r\n\r\nDjango-Pipeline settings is configured to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org/#using-less-installation) & [Yuglify](https://github.com/yui/yuglify) node.js packages for static files preprocessing & compression. When you deploy your site with collectstatic command these packages will be called. You can install both packages with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) (node.js package manager).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install -g less yuglify\r\n```\r\n\r\nDemo repository is following master branch on Doorsale, so you should pull changes frequently to keep things synchronized and running smoothly, see [demo project](https://github.com/mysteryjeans/doorsale-demo) readme for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nDoorsale is yet to be production ready, there are few tasks left in completeness, listed as follows.\r\n\r\n- Unit tests\r\n- Backoffice administration\r\n\r\n\r\n## Built With\r\n\r\n- [Django](https://github.com/django/django) &mdash; Web development framework for python, we utilizes full stack.\r\n- [LESS](https://github.com/less/less.js) &mdash; Our styling totally done in LESS, a preprocessor for CSS.\r\n- [Django-Pipeline](https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline) &mdash; We use django-pipeline to compile & compress LESS and also Javascript before deployment.\r\n- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) &mdash; Our primary database is PostgreSQL, although project intended to support all databases that Django supports.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nDoorsale is free and open-source, we support and encourages an active heathly community that accepts contributions from the public â€“ including you!\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing your pull requests!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Doorsale Demo Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/mysteryjeans/doorsale-demo/master/media/images/demo-screenshot.png)\r\n",
