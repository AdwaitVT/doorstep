To see Doorsale in action, visit [Demo](http://doorsale-demo.fanaticlab.com) site.


## Setting up Doorsale e-commerce

[Doorsale demo](https://github.com/mysteryjeans/doorsale-demo) repository is for quickly getting up and running e-commerce site on your local workstation, its readme contains all steps to setting up a site.

When you have enough testing on prepopulated data in demo projects, starting your own site from skretch is similar to creating project in Django.

Create a virtualenv for your own e-commerce project

```
$ virtualenv doorsale_env && source doorsale_env/bin/activate
```

Install the latest development version

```
$ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/mysteryjeans/doorsale.git#egg=Doorsale
```

Create a e-commerce project using doorsale-admin.py

```
$ doorsale-admin.py startproject doorsale_site
```

Create a database, new django project use SQLite by default, if you are new to databases this is good choice to start

```
$ python manage.py syncdb
```

Assuming [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) already installed, let's verify that your site works, run development server and visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000), you will see products catalog page with no products and categories

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Django-Pipeline settings is configured to use [Less](http://lesscss.org/#using-less-installation) & [Yuglify](https://github.com/yui/yuglify) node.js packages for static files compression. When you deploy your site with collectstatic command these packages will be called. You can install both packages with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) (node.js package manager).

```
$ npm install -g less yuglify 
```

Demo repository is following master branch on Doorsale, so you should pull changes frequently to keep things synchronized and running smoothly, see [demo project](https://github.com/mysteryjeans/doorsale-demo) readme for more details.
